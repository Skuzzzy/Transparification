## Contributing ##
To add websites and organisations to this extension, they need to be added to the server side.

Submit a pull request to https://github.com/magicmark/Transparification-Server, adding to "information.js"

## TODO: ##
- Find a source to ease curation of content
- Make it so the server returns a complete list of site data every so often (maybe)
- Hash/encode site hostnames in some way
- Add 'parents' for sites to enable recursive checking
